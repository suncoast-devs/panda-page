            (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dà xióng māo),
            also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south
            central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive
            black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round
            body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it
            from the red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the
            giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up
            more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will
            occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the
            form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive
            honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along
            with specially prepared food.
          </p>

            The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
            mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a
            result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant
            panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

            The giant panda is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007
            report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and
            another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas
            lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 different
            countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that
            there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006
            study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high
            as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant
            pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news
            site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had
            increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified
            the species from "endangered" to "vulnerable".

              While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol,
              internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As
              such, it is becoming widely used within China in international
              contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion
              coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.
